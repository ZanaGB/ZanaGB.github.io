			<h1>How becoming a Bimbo saved my life</h1>
			<p>Alright, this article is by far unusual for the type of stuff I post here. But it's something I want to note because there's a bunch of important lessons to be had from this.</p>
			<p>The title of the article is not a joke, or clickbait. It is certainly unusual, but there's a lot of truth to it, as an artist, and as a person, and with the circumstances that surround me. It should, however, not be taken entirely literally, as I’m sure some people will.</p>
			<p>I will put this properly into writing and add more history, but the gist of it is... Just be who you want to be, draw what you love to draw, and don't shy away from those things that interest you and pique your curiosity. You'll otherwise end up dead alive, not knowing who and what you are, being resentful of others, and just not knowing where you belong... Despite maybe having known exactly where a decade earlier.</p>
			<p>This article is heavily personal, and can be harsh at points. So reader discretion is advised.</p>
			<p>And now, without further ado...</p>

			<h2>Act 1: How to destroy your life and identity in 10 easy steps.</h2>
			<p>Or, how trying to appease people, and ignore who you truly are will pretty much kill you.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>	</p>
			</br>
			<p>It's hard to write this, without going over intimate, revealing details of my personal life, so. I want to apologize in advance for any deliberate plot holes through here. Wording through this document is left intentionally vague.</p>
			<p>To understand the radical change in direction on my social media, the very revamp of this website, and how I've been looking at the world since the start of June 2021, we need to go back in time roughly 15 years, into the far-gone year 2006.</p>
			<p>They say that times past are always better, but I could not disagree more with that statement. Nostalgia is certainly incredibly dangerous. And so is the expectations people place upon you to keep it intact.</p>
			<p>For many, present-day me looks like a complete departure of form, from what I used to do and the type of art I've been doing. The irony, is that it does not take a genius to see that things were already pointing in this direction circa 2011.</p>
			<p>However, during that time, the need for appeasement grew larger, as personal situations degraded heavily, my life was going through several changes, and rather than trying to figure myself out, I opted for attempting to be what people wrongly expected from me, or, rightfully, if we want to think their intentions were nefarious all along.</p>
			<p>What followed was a series of events that culminated in Summer, 2013. A year before this website was first online. This website, originally, was part of these initial efforts of appeasement. Believe it or not.</p>
			<p>I was forced to give up on all the things I was interested on, to give up on all the things I was starting to discover, to give up on being myself, on being fun. Just to become the blandest thing that appeased those in control and in power, trying to just be the perfect, marketable, thing in the shadows that could just blend in. Be hired, and just disappear in an environment that would simply hate you forever, inside and outside of corporate reach.</p>
			<p>Suffice to say, they did get exactly what they wanted. I got nothing, and the subsequent effects would be devastating and felt to this day.</p>
			<p> </p>
			</br>
			<p> </p>
			</br>
			<p> </p>
			</br>

			<h2>Act 2: What is life like, pretending to be someone who you are not?</h2>
			<p>Or, how actually trying to appease people, always working beyond the safe zones in the name of "being capable" and "good enough to be in a competitive industry" and "not allowing anyone see anything ever" produced the figurative death of a person.</p>
			<hr>
			<p> </p>
			</br>
			<p>Growing up is weird. Growing up on the wrong environment is the worst. Growing up despite said environment forcing your hand and sabotaging you every step of the way is outright hell.</p>
			<p>So, it's gotten to that part of your life where everything's gone south, you've failed everything, they've destroyed all your possessions, and they give you the ultimatum of either becoming a mirror image of their twisted desires, or fend for yourself until you die under a bridge. What do you do?</p>
			<p>If you've have had your core destroyed to oblivion, of course you will choose the first option. Can I say it was a mistake? Perhaps. Did I really have any other choice? Perhaps not.</p>
			<p>Living, not only the life that others expect you to have, with the personality others expect you to have, while cutting you out of the outside world, and everything that ever mattered, while retaliating at any attempts at rebellion, and constantly moving the goalposts from practically superhuman feats, to the outright impossible, while being told flat on your face that nothing that you've ever done has ever mattered will have devastating consequences. But. What are you going to do? Run? They wish you could.</p>
			<p>Following unspeakable events, things went "well", for them, at the very least. They were getting all the results they were hoping for and more, while sweeping said effort under the rug.</p>
			<p>For me. It just started the downward spiral into absolute nothingness that would be the next 7 years of my life. Quite ironically, an incredibly tiresome, burn-out inducing, superhuman-feat ridden downward spiral into nothingness.</p>
			<p>Who in the world would know it takes so much energy and pain to be absolutely nothing?</p>
			<p>The next years were just built from regret, pain, guilt, and a manufactured aversion to all the things I loved, and all those things I was still trying to discover but were taken out of me prematurely. Convinced that everything, and everyone, everyone would just destroy me if I was ever allowed to have sympathy, enjoy things. Many bridges were burned. Many enemies were senselessly made.</p>
			<p>And as the isolation grew, the burned bridges became scorched earth, and those overseeing watched gleefully as their job-ready, marketable plaything drowned on pain of its own making. A desolating sense of emptiness, and lack of sense came over me. Not just in the typical sense, but a complete lack of sense, belonging, feelings. The seeds to utter and complete madness.</p>
			<p>Eventually, once nothing but a hollowed out, empty shell remained, I became the marketable thing they wanted, and got acquired by the corporate slaughterhouse as they truly wanted. Destroying what remained of a prior self. Sanitized. Obliterated. Self-Actualization, Fun, Art. Everything got replaced by being the efficient sub-minimum wage bitch they wanted.</p>
			<p>As a miracle, somehow. A few people from a time now long past remained, which battled endlessly towards keeping my own work alive, alongside myself. One of them, coming out with an olive branch, a sign of peace. After having gone nuclear years prior.</p>
			<p>Despite that. Art stagnated, the topics outright died. Originality vanished. Art just became yet another technical issue to be fixed. Something to look at, optimize, polish, optimize again. No soul, no substance. Only pain, and optimization.</p>
			<p>Day to day operations mainly consisted of working on beyond capability, providing "excellent experiences" to everyone behind the headset, while continuously working on the danger zone, to appease those outside of the slaughterhouse, pretending there were no gaping holes, no wounds, and no overworked, burnt out piles of disaster and disappointment.</p>
			<p>It would take years of the constant grating and shredding away inside and outside, by the corporate gods, their idols, and the inner circles, for the first major breakdown to occur.</p>
			<p>What followed, was a year of pain, and a pandemic. Light seemingly shone at the end of the tunnel. But alas, it was a short lived mirage. After one final push, one final attempt at over-performing, being the unstoppable force against the un-movable wall. Disaster struck, and bigotry showed it’s ugly head.</p>
			<p>What really transpired is a mystery to everyone but the three people on that room, but the official records just cited a classic, far too familiar line. "Insufficient performance”.</p>
			<p>At that point, what followed just ill-fated attempts at picking up whatever was left. And go forwards onto the never ending hell of further appeasing corporations, after having failed spectacularly.</p>
			<p>Officially. I hit rock bottom. The worst 6 months, and a complete disintegration of the soul and sense of self.</p>
			<p> </p>

			<h2>Act 3: People will hate you no matter what</h2>
			<p>And, if you can't change that outcome, why not just love yourself instead?</p>
			<hr>
			<p> </p>
			</br>
			<p>It was then, when everything was lost, and nothing remained. All of what left was an inert mass, an empty husk.</p>
			<p>And yet, it refused to die.</p>
			<p>As the successive interviews continued to start brightly, all smiles, all hopes, "selling the motorcycle" as they say... Only for being ghosted, or getting rejected with feeble excuses. A realization dawned.</p>
			<p>"Doing my best never worked, it was never enough. Selling myself to corporations and being who I am not, has never worked, it has never been enough. They've always found a way to hate me and discard me, one way or another. Personally, no amount of appeasing or superhuman effort ever worked, I was hated all the same, I was never enough..."</p>
			<p>"...If I can't change that outcome, why shouldn't I just love myself instead?"</p>
			<p>And then. Something clicked.</p>
			<p>It was now the start of June, 2021. Doing one picture for the sake of, doing one picture, improving upon old, rusty, but tried and true skills that did not get enough time to shine previously.</p>
			<p>Someone, whom I have no idea how we met, how we started talking, or why we kept talking, given our massive differences, made a joke based upon the underlying sketch of what would become my latest pixel art piece, at the time of writing.</p>
			<p>It started out with just the stupidest of outcomes. "Oh yeah? Silly over-sized chests on Sonic Characters? I used to do that, let me out-gross you"</p>
			<p>And the result followed... A mere day later. For someone who would take weeks to complete the simplest of tasks. Roughly 10 hours of total work. A lifetime achievement, A noticeable uplift in quality. For a joke. A joke that was meant to be effortless, meaningless. And yet...</p>
			<p>Something else clicked. For the first time in a decade... I wanted to be the content of the picture. The original joke about a boy genius tasked with helping save the world time and time again, engineering the most complex of things... Reduced to a prime example of super-normal stimuli, with an empty looking stare, and an even emptier brain. Freed from the constraints of pressure, appearance, outward opinion, of super human feats. It was irresistible, and I just wanted to become that.</p>
			<p>At this point, The rocket had already lifted off, and was already nearing Max-Q</p>
			<p>It would not take a genius to figure out what just happened. Repressed feelings, thoughts. Imagery, from over a decade ago, rushing back at me. The flood gates literally open.</p>
			<p>Upon this realization, a handful of conversations happened with those few people who stuck with me years prior, despite all my attempts at going nuclear at them.</p>
			<p>From those conversations, would germinate the prototypical axioms of the namesake of this HTML document.</p>
			<p>Bimbos, as portrayed by popular media. Are self centered, empty brained entities, with very strong hedonistic tendencies. They care not for society at large, and don't bother at all with pretending to be smart, or attempting to do superhuman, burnout inducing feats to just get through another Wednesday. They are dumb, unapologetically so, and they get exactly what they want, despite their seeming appearance of weak and powerless. Media also likes to switch things around and present the concept of the Smart Bimbo. Which is functionally indistinguishable from the former, except they're able to school someone on their chosen, or preferred field. A modern take on the idiot savant trope.</p>
			<p>And while it is a complete joke on the surface. There is a lot to unpack here, coming from the situation I come in, and a lot of things that can be practically applied on the day to day life.</p>
			<p>The first and most important aspect. Self Centered Hedonism: At a first glance, it can be mistaken with egocentrism and narcissism. However, that is not necessarily the case. A lifetime of experience has taught me that. Prioritizing your own happiness does not mean prioritizing your own happiness <span class="Emphasis">ABOVE ALL ELSE, AND SPECIFICALLY AT THE COST OF EVERYONE ELSE'S HAPPINESS AND LIFE PROSPECTS</span></p>
			<p>The second, but also just as important aspect. The embrace of stupidity, and economizing brain power: This one is particularly relevant to day to day operations, as, for the most part, I've always been stuck playing pretend, trying to perform above all realistic ceilings just to appear to be indistinguishable from other peers, from an executive perspective, alongside many others. Pretend you can process the thing, that you can realize the other thing, that the entire paragraph that was spoken to you did not sound like incoherent mumbling to you. Quickly fill all the gaps. Engage the branch predictor! Try to predict what they will say 5 turns from now! Stay ahead of the game, anticipate every possible need, be always at the ready. Figure every possible need! Manage every aspect of the household! Make your thoughts the thoughts of 5 people, Successfully get EVERYTHING DONE for everyone. Then pretend to be a buzzing bee in a gathering with strangers!...</p>
			<p>Yeah... How about no? Each successive breakdown has irreversibly lowered the ceiling to what I can do, and how I can operate normally, being forced to use that bit of your brain you use when your house's on fire and you got to get out of there ASAP. It is time to become, and time to just accept what I can do, what I can't do. For what's worth. I can just be some silly klutz that's forgetful, slow, and needs things repeated to them alongside immensely specific instructions for everything. Absolutely no developmental problems or an eternity or burnout in sight. Just, blissful ignorance. Economize every single thought. Don't fire any neuron that does not need to be fired. Completely disregard the anxiety and panic of engaging the branch predictor, or the pain of trying to be perfect in every moment. Embrace the stupidity and just be yourself. Flaws, and all.</p>
			<p>A third point that's also important and relevant is the overall body positivism, and the lack of fears of embracing supernormal bodies. Crank that femininity to eleven, not to appease some random dude, but because that's your body, and that's how you wanna be. A bombshell but for yourself only. Coupled with that, there's a whole lot of carefree attitude, and a lack of regards for what others think, just opting to do what makes them happy. One can say that's certainly something to live by.</p>
			<p>There's certainly more to the conversations that were had. But the following axioms can be synthesized from the conversations that were had.</p>
			<p><span class="Tabulation"><span class="Emphasis">1: </span>It is healthy to stop being selfless. And pursue your own happiness, and put yourself front and center of your own life. While being mindful of others and help them still, but not devoting your own life to selflessly do things for people and sink on the mud.</span></p>
			<p><span class="Tabulation"><span class="Emphasis">2: </span>Happiness and fun over all else. There's a time for everything in life, but life should not consist entirely of being dull, gray, boring, and invisible. If the moment does not call for utmost seriousness, why not just have fun and look at the bright side on the small things?. Besides, if tasks can be only completed while having fun, regardless of technical expertise, you may as well focus on those things that bring you joy.</span></p>
			<p><span class="Tabulation"><span class="Emphasis">3: </span>Embrace imperfections and own limits. This one ties to points 4 and 5 later on. Nobody is perfect, nobody has the perfect response for everything, there's no such thing as a perfect human. Spending needless amounts of energy on trying to be perfect is futile. And if you somehow succeed, all you'll ever get is a sterile husk with no feelings, goals, or purpose, hated by everyone, and by oneself. You may be able to predict what people can say with some accuracy, you maybe able to get ahead of the game at some point, you can burn out just trying to be the perfect version of yourself depending of who you're talking to. It's unhealthy and an overall mess. Not good enough for human relationships, and oddly enough, not even good enough for the big corps either. Corporations love to suck the soul out of people, they don't want pre-sucked souls.</span></p>
			<p><span class="Tabulation"><span class="Emphasis">4: </span>Being silly, and clumsy is good. Beyond it's ties with 3, it's also related to 2. Nobody likes a straight plank of wood with sharp edges in every corner. Flaws makes us human. And for the most part there's no shame to be had on it. People forget things all the time, people have issues with things all the time, people need help all the time. Mistakes happen, misunderstandings happen. People can be a little bit awkward at times. And there's a life beyond the sterile corporate water cooler talk. People will always appreciate a round, flawed human with their own silliness, quirks, needs and workarounds for things. It is what character is all about. It makes you complete, it makes you, yourself. Sure, your "round character" may look a little bit like a lumpy potato, but people can appreciate that. Nobody will appreciate the ether.</span></p>
			<p><span class="Tabulation"><span class="Emphasis">5: </span>Limit the operational ceiling. Possibly the hardest one to achieve, and the hardest one to properly understand and analyze. As life goes on, and as you're put through hell and back, and forced to become an unholy perfect amalgam of all the terrible things in the world. It's inevitable to end up trying to go above and beyond, making everything about productivity, appeasing everyone, read their mind, pretend to be that completely fake, irreal, and unobtainable "real person" they've forced you to try to be all your life. Finding all the small things that take a lot of energy, just to appear less "weird", more "abled". 90% of the time, they don't even work and that effort was wasted. Or worse, it's by trying to follow those things, how all the problems become more pronounced and forced. It is time to reduce the operational ceiling, limit the workloads at any given moment, and start discarding all the useless things that have been leeching off from me through the years. On the subject of discarding stuff, and linking with point 1 and 2. It is also always a good idea to disengage from communities and people who just cause you distress, and for some other people, politely request space to think and to exist.</span></p>
			<p><span class="Tabulation"><span class="Emphasis">6: </span>Stop worrying about the unknown, what others could think. Et cetera. Life is too short to worry about the potential judgment of someone you'll most likely never ever see, anyway.</span></p>
			<p>From there, it was just a matter of applying my own principles onto the day to day life.</p>
			<p>The results were, practically immediate, and, despite the current status of burnout, I still feel that it was the greatest thing ever.</p>
			<p>Unchained by other people, and from judgment, both external and internal, art production ramped up immensely, in a month, producing more artwork than in the entirety of 2020, and more than the art throughput of the years 2015-2019 combined (demoscene content notwithstanding). Art quality improved in spades. No longer bound by self censorship, quality improved and opportunities for more dynamic expressions, poses, and camera angles arose.</p>
			<p>By now, we have reached Lagrange Point.</p>
			<p>What followed, was the natural conclusion for the ultimate token of self-expression that I own. A redesign of the character I use for my online interactions.</p>
			<p>After a small conversation with beloved and supportive <a href="https://twitter.com/mif_maf">MifMaf</a> She ended up coming up with a small silly doodle, which I would take onto myself as the basis for the redesign going forward.</p>

			<p> </p>
			</br>
			<p>From there, I ultimately decided to go onto <a href="https://twitter.com/ZanaGB/status/1405433378451738628">opening first through this thread</a>, alongside a revamp of my social media presnce, which would culminate on the complete rework of this own very website, the finalization of the <a href="/pages/comms.html">commissions page</a>, and it's request form. And the start of this very article you're reading now.</p>
			<p>The next weeks would be hectic, making art left and right, discovering that I loved things that I used to hate, well, that I was forced to hate things I used to love, and then I fell in love with them again. Go onto drawing and enjoying all the weird stuff I shunned for so long. I'd find and discover emotions and feelings I've only thought of them as being the stuff of fiction, I reconnected with some old friends and in all, I turned my life upside down, in the best possible way.</p>
			</br>
			<p> </p>

			<h2>Act 4: And the rest, as they say, it's history</h2>
			<p>Or, how to keep looking forward while observing your impending doom.</p>
			<hr>
			<p> </p>
			</br>
			<p>Now. That I turned my life upside down, and I managed to finally get a good outlook in life despite everything does not mean my life suddenly improved. Quite the contrary.</p>
			<p>The whole of the year has been spent still trying to get back on my feet, and work on my ultimate goal of independence, despite all the many rejections. School enrolling season draws near, and I literally can not say no to the ultimately fruitless offer, for as they demand it be done, or else I shall prepare for unforeseen consequences. (The irony is that between weird biases and a whole lot of institutionalized gambling, I can just do everything right there, and not get through)</p>
			<p>From a health perspective, I've had a bunch of scares and I'm now dealing with the uncertainty of supplies for things I need to remain healthy being nonexistent, and not having a job to buy them when the lone unit happens to come into some storage room somewhere.</p>
			<p>Employment in a post-pandemic world is certainly weird, and IT staff are certainly dime a dozen, with the many catch 22's and awkward tropes that it entails. Or the fact that only inaccessible places are the only ones that currently are hiring, at sub-par salaries.</p>
			<p>From where I am in life, I still am at that rock bottom, I did not really move anywhere. But I am now ready with the ability to look at things positively, and perhaps now seek for other alternatives, and other ways out, rather than being unhealthily stubborn and force my way through life in hopes of an escape.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>All in all, this is still just the beginning, and I may have begun late. But it certainly beats having not existed at all, having given up, and becoming all the things I've ever feared, then ultimately vanishing from the earth.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>And with this, this silly article is now over. An article of personal struggle, of conflict, toxicity, unspoken horrors, but also...</p>
			<p> </p>
			<h1>How becoming a Bimbo saved my life.</h1>
			<p> </p>
			<p>If you've managed to read this through the end. I want to thank you inmensely for dedicating the time to read on this thing. It means a lot to me, and, I hope that my own story may help others on similar situations, or put things onto perspective for people.</p>

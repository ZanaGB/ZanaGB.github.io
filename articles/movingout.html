			<h1>The Bunny Party is moving!</h1>
			<p>Nothing serious. But bunnies.party is moving away from being a static, self-hosted website, and onto github pages!</p>
			<p>This somewhat puts a damper to my plans to make a website that's easier to mantain and edit for, but it solves the most inpending problem i'm having currently, which is the fact that i will soon lose pretty much everything, and the server where i'm publishing this first will cease to exist in a handful of months.</p>
			<p>Since, due to personal reasons, i may never be able to get this back up as a local server, and since thankfully this website is barebones as heck. I am being able to move my home into a github pages instance to keep it existing even under catastrophical conditions.</p>
			<br>
			<p>This is the whole of the update, really. You're probably reading this after i migrated, too.<p>

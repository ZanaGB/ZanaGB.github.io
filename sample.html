			<h1>Website Revamp Test</h1>
			<p>Congratulations, you found <b>The CSS Test</b> page. Since moving to a GitHub Pages instance, it's been crucial to simplify the CSS of the website while making it look good.</p>
			<p>Main goals are to try to leverage the defaults of each browser as much as possible while keeping neat things like that Portfolio class I made where it shows images on a 3 row thingamagig. The result will be a definitely more boring website. But hopefully one you'll want to read.</p>
			<p>Individual Image Time</p>

			<h2><a href="/index.html">And an h2 test. This time with A LINK!</a></h2>
			<p>Now a code block will follow</p>
			<p>Here's where i'd have my monospace block... If i defined it on CSS</p>
			<p>And one last paragraph, this one will be long to test some other random properties like how text will wrap around on smaller devices, on top of providing some filler to see how scrolling works, if any. Honestly compared to the table based design this is a lot cleaner. I need to find a way a way to do CSS indentation instead of hacking spaces in the HTML code. I will maybe create a class of one tab, two tabs, three tabs, four tabs, five tabs, six tabs, seven tabs and eight tabs, i hope i don't need to tabulate any code for that long but nobody knows. It's something that ought to work</p>

			<h1>ABOUT THIS WEBSITE</h1>
			<p>This is my personal pet project, portfolio, and overall testing ground for stuff.</p>
			<p>There is not a lot to say about the website, really. Currently it's in a very early WIP state, but you will  eventually see more details here and there as it's built. I intend for this website to essentially represent all things me. My art, my photography, music doodles, opinion pieces, so on, so forth. On top of finally adding a proper ToS page for my commissions, and a way for people to check things out all in all.</p>
			<p>I am well aware this is an unorthodox way, considering there are so many websites to do one of these things at a time, but i want a simple website, with the minimum amount of tracking, no random stuff. Just content.</p>
			<p>On top of this being a platform for self advertisment this is also a good refresher on web technologies, and server management. This website is essentially living proof of most of my skills, as everything is configured manually by me and it exists throuth my own force.</p>
			<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
			<p><span class="Emphasis">TODO:</span> Write the actual info about myself. Maybe add a CV alongside demonstrable skills. Needs further consideration.</p>
			
			
			
			<p>Here is a table that looks like an apple</p>

			<p>I need to see why the table is broken on mobile.
			</p>
			
			<p>Turns out it's not broken on mobile. I did not change the CSS at all, it works now. I am baffled.

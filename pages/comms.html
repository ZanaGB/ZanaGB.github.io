			<h1>Artwork Commission Terms of Service</h1>
				<h2>
					Second Revision - July 2021
				</h2>
				<p>
					<span class="Emphasis">Warning: </span> The following page does include art considered NSFW. proceed at your own risk
				</p>
				<div class="CodeBlock">
					<p>1: I can be contacted through the commissioning form at the bottom of the page. It will ask for your e-mail and other details, so I can reach you, comment finer details, and send you invoices.</p>
					<br>
					<p>2: While I lean towards safe stuff, I am happy to draw certain types of NSFW content. <span class="CodeComment">However I won’t be drawing any gore, violence, outright porn, or things like deceit, manipulation, loss of identity and/or humanity, acting over a third party without consent, and others</span>. If you want to ask for an NSFW artwork, don't hesitate to ask me beforehand.</p>
					<br>
					<p>3: It’s really important you give me all of the details of the commission, alongside all the visual references needed before I get to work, so <span class="FileComment">be very, very thorough.</span></p>
					<br>
					<p>4: I will be posting downscaled WIPs as I work on the commission to update on how is it going. You’re entitled to making 3 major edits before the sketch is set in stone, so you can ensure the pose’s right, and any other details. After that, things will just follow their natural course to completion.</p>
					<br>
					<p>5: Life gets to us all, and on average, I usually take about <span class="FileComment">45 days to complete the more complex commissions</span>. On less busy weeks I can get more done faster, but this estimate covers most bases.</p>
					<br>
					<p>6: Once you email me all the details, and we agree to start the commission, <span class="CodeComment">I will be asking for 60% of the cost, once I am done, I will ask for the other 40% before I send the finished image.</span> One first invoice will be sent before i start working, then the last invoice will be sent before i send the finished picture</p>
					<br>
					<p>7: As an extra, you can request the source file for <span class="FileComment">an additional 15% of the commission price, with a price floor of 10 euros</span>, if the percentage weren’t to reach that.</p>
					<br>
					<p>8: <span class="CodeComment">Very Important</span>: Having the source file entitles you to look at it, dissect it and research and learn from it. It does, HOWEVER, not entitle you to repost it elsewhere.</p>

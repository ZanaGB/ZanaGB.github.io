			<h1>Artwork Commission Terms of Service</h1>
				<h2>Third Revision - February 2022</h2>
				<div class="CodeBlock">
					<p><span class="FileComment">0: Currently, and for the foreseeable future, I am only taking sketch commissions as I work through burnout.</span> As stated on their section, prices range from <span class="CodeComment">55 to 85 euros in basis of their complexity.</span> For those who fancy some color, that'll be a flat extra of 15 euros on top of the estimate.</p>
					<br>
					<p>0b: If, for some reason, while working on low power mode, the circumstances <span class="CodeComment">ABSOLUTELY</span> require me to do a fully rendered picture and or faster turnaround. <span class="CodeComment">A burnout tax of 450% of the total estimate will be applied.</span></p>
					<br>
					<p>1: I can be contacted through the commissioning form at the bottom of the page. It will ask for your e-mail and other details, so I can reach you, comment finer details, and send you invoices.</p>
					<br>
					<p>2: While I lean towards safe stuff, I am happy to draw certain types of NSFW content. <span class="CodeComment">However I won’t be drawing any gore, violence, outright porn, or things like deceit, manipulation, loss of identity and/or humanity, acting over a third party without consent, and others</span>. If you want to ask for an NSFW artwork, don't hesitate to ask me beforehand.</p>
					<br>
					<p>3: It’s really important you give me all of the details of the commission, alongside all the visual references needed before I get to work, so <span class="FileComment">be very, very thorough.</span></p>
					<br>
					<p>4: I will be posting downscaled WIPs as I work on the commission to update on how is it going. You’re entitled to making 3 major edits before the sketch is set in stone, so you can ensure the pose’s right, and any other details. After that, things will just follow their natural course to completion.</p>
					<br>
					<p>5: Life gets to us all, and on average, I usually take about <span class="FileComment">45 days to complete the more complex commissions</span>. On less busy weeks I can get more done faster, but this estimate covers most bases.</p>
					<br>
					<p>6: Once you email me all the details, and we agree to start the commission, <span class="CodeComment">I will be asking for 60% of the cost, once I am done, I will ask for the other 40% before I send the finished image.</span> One first invoice will be sent before i start working, then the last invoice will be sent before i send the finished picture</p>
					<br>
					<p>7: As an extra, you can request the source file for <span class="FileComment">an additional 15% of the commission price, with a price floor of 10 euros</span>, if the percentage weren’t to reach that.</p>
					<br>
					<p>8: <span class="CodeComment">Very Important</span>: Having the source file entitles you to look at it, dissect it and research and learn from it. It does <span class="CodeComment">NOT</span> entitle you to post it elsewhere. The source is only for your personal use. It is <span class="CodeComment">not</span> to be made public.</p>
					<br>
					<p>9: <span class="CodeComment">As an extension of point 8, this means, that while you may own the right for your character, I own full rights over the commission that has been agreed upon, the final render image, and it's source file, and they <span class="FileComment">can not be modified, reposted, resold, redistributed, regurgitated, sold as an NFT, be introduced on the blockchain, printed or any such other thing.</span></span></p>
					<br>
					<p>9b: Printing/Merchandising rights can be negotiated upon if needed.</p>
					<br>
					<p>10: Agreement to the commission is agreeing and adhering exclusively to all of the items and restrictions presented on this document.</p>
				</div>
